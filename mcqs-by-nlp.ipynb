The main aim of OOPs is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.\nA Class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type. Using classes, you can create multiple objects with the same behavior instead of writing their code multiple times. This includes classes for objects occurring more than once in your code. In general, class declarations can include these components in order: \n\nModifiers: A class can be public or have default access (Refer to this for details).\nClass name: The class name should begin with the initial letter capitalized by convention.\nBody: The class body is surrounded by braces, { }.\nAn Object is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming that represents real-life entities. A typical Java program creates many objects, which as you know, interact by invoking methods. The objects are what perform your code, they are the part of your code visible to the viewer/user. An object mainly consists of: \n\nState: It is represented by the attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.\nBehavior: It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object to other objects.\nIdentity: It is a unique name given to an object that enables it to interact with other objects.\nMethod: A method is a collection of statements that perform some specific task and return the result to the caller. A method can perform some specific task without returning anything. Methods allow us to reuse the code without retyping it, which is why they are considered time savers. In Java, every method must be part of some class, which is different from languages like C, C++, and Python. \n\"\"\"\nmcqs = generate_mcqs(tech_text, num_questions=10)  # Pass the selected number of questions\n# Ensure each MCQ is formatted correctly as (question_stem, answer_choices, correct_answer)\nmcqs_with_index = [(i + 1, mcq) for i, mcq in enumerate(mcqs)]\n\nfor question in mcqs_with_index:\n    print(\"Question\", question[0], \":\", question[1][0])\n    print(\"Options:\")\n    options = question[1][1]\n    for i, option in enumerate(options):\n        print(f\"{chr(97 + i)}) {option}\")\n    print(\"Correct Answer:\", question[1][2])\n    print(\"\\n\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-27T02:27:56.683890Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-27T02:27:56.684431Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-27T02:27:56.867120Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-27T02:27:56.684391Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-27T02:27:56.866023Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Question 1 : Using __________, you can create multiple objects with the same behavior instead of writing their code multiple times.\nOptions:\na) times\nb) classes\nc) code\nd) times\nCorrect Answer: B\n\n\nQuestion 2 : In general, __________ declarations can include these components in order: \n\n\nOptions:\na) order\nb) class\nc) components\nd) declarations\nCorrect Answer: B\n\n\nQuestion 3 : A __________ can perform some specific task without returning anything.\nOptions:\na) task\nb) task\nc) task\nd) method\nCorrect Answer: D\n\n\nQuestion 4 : It represents the __________ of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type.\nOptions:\na) objects\nb) set\nc) objects\nd) objects\nCorrect Answer: B\n\n\nQuestion 5 : The objects are what perform your __________, they are the part of your __________ visible to the viewer/user.\nOptions:\na) code\nb) viewer\nc) part\nd) viewer\nCorrect Answer: A\n\n\nQuestion 6 : __________: It is represented by the methods of an object.\nOptions:\na) methods\nb) methods\nc) Behavior\nd) methods\nCorrect Answer: C\n\n\nQuestion 7 : In Java, every __________ must be part of some class, which is different from languages like C, C++, and Python. \n\nOptions:\na) languages\nb) method\nc) languages\nd) class\nCorrect Answer: B\n\n\nQuestion 8 : __________ allow us to reuse the code without retyping it, which is why they are considered time savers.\nOptions:\na) Methods\nb) savers\nc) time\nd) savers\nCorrect Answer: A\n\n\nQuestion 9 : \nObject-oriented __________ aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc. in __________.\nOptions:\na) world\nb) inheritance\nc) programming\nd) polymorphism\nCorrect Answer: C\n\n\nQuestion 10 : It also reflects the __________ of an object.\n\nOptions:\na) object\nb) object\nc) object\nd) properties\nCorrect Answer: D\n\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":2}]}
